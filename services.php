		<h6>Market Research &amp; Analysis</h6> 
		Among the services we offer is financial analysis and market research. Market research is
		the focused study of different marketing strategies and the effects they have on different
		segments of the population.<br /><br />

		A market researcher may decide to populate a focus group with people of a particular
		demographic and then ask them questions about their responses to different products or
		advertisements. The market researcher then uses this feedback to shape future marketing
		campaigns, or even change the product itself.<br /><br />

		One of the most important demographic distinctions our market researchers make concerns
		wealth and pricing. People with different amounts of money favor products in different price
		ranges, and so setting your price to target the investors or customers you’re looking for is
		absolutely essential.<br /><br />

		The whole point of market research is to construct a detailed marketing plan, which is itself
		a tool to attract investors.

		Crypto OTC is when trading of crypto is involved directly between the two parties. That trade
		can be crypto-to-crypto or Fiat-to-Crypto. The trade always occurs between a dedicated trading
		desk with the involvement of another institution who is providing OTC services, known as
		counter party.<br /><br />

		<h6>Why do Crypto OTC Services exist?</h6>
		Buying or selling huge volume of crypto is difficult. Mainly because no single entity sells huge
		volume all alone and when buying from different traders, you would become a victim of
		slippage. The first trade would be at market price but subsequent ones would be at higher
		market price because the trading would increase investor’s interest. And soon the last lot would
		be available at a much higher price than what you have started with. This is known as Slippage.<br /><br />

		So it is better to spread your purchase through multiple exchanges. Hence, OTC services.
		These would quote you one price and would get all the required volume of crypto at that price
		for you. They excel at sourcing large volume of crypto assets. <br /><br />

		<h6>How does a Principal desk works?</h6>
		Some OTC Service providers use this method where they source whatever crypto you are
		buying through their own funds. They assume the risk in this process. The risk is that they have
		to source the crypto assets in a way they can make a profit and not end up incurring huge
		losses. Once agreed upon assets are purchased, the client would wire the money and get the
		crypto assets in his wallet as per agreement.<br /><br />
		<strong>GENTLECRYPTO OTC DESK</strong> is the fastest way to buy and sell Bulk Bitcoin,
		Etherum and Tether at the best rate. <br /><br />
